A prototype that builds and reloads a Play application with Gradle (without sbt)

NOTE: Error reporting is not properly implemented so you have to check the command line out put for errors

# Running
Run (you can change the source and hit reload in the browser, but you need to check the command line output to see errors):

    ./gradlew play-run

# Building 
Build templates and routes and compile them (and the source code):

    ./gradlew build
